    """this class solves two problems with multithreaded
    programs in Python, (1) a signal might be delivered
    to any thread (which is just a malfeature) and (2) if
    the thread that gets the signal is waiting, the signal
    is ignored (which is a bug).

    The watcher is a concurrent process (not thread) that
    waits for a signal and the process that contains the
    threads.

    I have only tested this on Linux.  I would expect it to
    work on the Macintosh and not work on Windows.

    The Watcher should be instantiated before the threads were
    created. It would kill threads when Ctrl-C was pressed.
